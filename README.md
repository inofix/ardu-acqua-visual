# ardu-acqua-visual

Just for fun..

For the flussbad-berlin.de project we want to visualize the
sensor values in a very basic and inexpensive way. So I just
got a little 5" touchscreen for the raspberry pi which is
connected to the arduino collecting sensor data. I then put
the whole stuff into an old wooden wine box...

This is just a first test to see whether the raspberry pi is
not getting too busy..
